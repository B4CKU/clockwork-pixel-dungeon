# Clockwork Pixel Dungeon

A fork of [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon) by [00-Evan](https://shatteredpixel.com/) which is based on the [source code of Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://www.watabou.ru).

It's basically an amalgamation of my concepts and ideas, with no specific theme or direction yet.

Current planned features:
- minor item rebalances
- tinkerer class
- seer class
- post end-game content
